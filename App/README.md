## Introduction

My professional minimalist portfolio, made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), powered by [&#x25B2;Vercel](https://vercel.com/)!

## Download the code

Open your directory where you save your repositories and clone it with the following command:

```shell
# From GitHub
git clone https://github.com/alitfal/Portfolio_alitago.git
```

## Set up the project

This project needs a `.env` into the `App` directory with some data related to your EmailJS service (Make sure you have an EmailJS account created, you can create one in the [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) official website):

```conf
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_code
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_code
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_code
```

## Install dependencies

As well, this project must be initialized and the necessary dependencies installed with the following command (Make sure you are in the `App` directory):

```shell
npm install
```

## Final steps

If you have Node v22.14 or higher installed on your machine, then you are good to go!

To check if you already have Node installed on your machine, run `node -v` in your terminal. Otherwise, you will need to install Node v22.14 or higher or, as a last option, check out the [Docker](#using-docker) alternative.

Finally, if you have Node installed, run the following command to run the development server (Make sure you are in the `App` directory):

```shell
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
# Press 'Ctrl + C' to exit
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Using Docker

### Run with Docker Compose

Make sure to create and configurate the `.env` file correctly into the `App` directory before running Docker commands...

Build the container:

```shell
docker compose build
```

Run the container:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Stop the container:

```shell
docker compose down
```

### Build Docker image on your own

If you don't have Node v22.14 or higher installed on your machine, you can build a Docker image by running the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) (Make sure to create and configurate the `.env` file correctly into the `App` directory before building the docker image).

Open a terminal and run the following command (Make sure you are in the `App` directory):

```shell
docker build -t portfolio .
```

After the build completes, you can run your container with the following command:

```shell
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 portfolio
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Please note that when using Docker, port 3000 on localhost will be occupied by the Discord application for its proper functioning.
> 
> If you already have applications that use port 3000, you will need to adjust certain parameters before creating the Docker container so that it can run correctly on a free port.
